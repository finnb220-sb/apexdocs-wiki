    >Assigned when veterans apply for VA health care. This system helps to make sure that Veterans who need care right away can get signed up quickly. We assign Veterans with
        service-connected disabilities the highest priority. We assign the lowest priority to Veterans who earn a higher income and who donâ€™t have any service-connected
        disabilities qualifying them for disability compensation (monthly payments).</description>
