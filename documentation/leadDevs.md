## Push the latest into your Org

Since you are the owner of your Team Box, you are responsible to maintain it with the latest code

    - `git checkout origin/release/#.#.#` - switches you to the release branch
    - `git pull` - grabs any updates from the origin (cloud)
    - (Warning: this will overwrite any changes still in-flight)<br>
      `npm run push:force` - pushes the fresh code changes into your org
