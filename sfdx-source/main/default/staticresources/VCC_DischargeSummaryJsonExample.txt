Chronic hepatitis C.\r\nAXIS IV.       No diagnosis.\r\nAXIS V.        Global assessment of functioning admission, 35.\r\n \r\nPROCEDURES:\r\nGroup therapy.\r\n \r\nSUBJECTIVE:\r\nMr. Striplin is a 46-year-old male white who presents with a chief\r\ncomplaint of \"I freaked out\".  This man has a long history of substance\r\ndependence and borderline personality disorder.  He has had over twenty\r\nadmission to 6A in the past six years for alcohol detoxification, suicide\r\nattempts or suicidal thoughts.  He was hospitalized on 6A in July of 98.\r\nAt that time he was suicidal because he was facing a prison sentence.\r\nFollowing discharge from that admission he fled to Oklahoma but the bounty\r\nhunters found him and brought him back to West Virginia.  He then served\r\nsix months in the regional jail for driving on a suspended license.  After\r\nhe got out of prison he went to Key West where he ended up living the life\r\nof an alcoholic vagabond.  He spent some time in psychiatric facility\r\nthere before deciding to return to the Martinsburg area.  He was admitted\r\nto 6 A for reasons that were unclear about two and half weeks ago.  He was\r\nthen transferred to the substance abuse treatment program.  He left the\r\nDOM substance abuse program on the 1st day of May after he got his\r\nnon-service connected check.  He checked into a motel and began drinking\r\nand used some heroin.  He was apparently picked up on the streets by the\r\npolice and brought to the Emergency Room where he was found to be\r\ndehydrated and in need of a medical admission.  \r\n \r\nOBJECTIVE MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:\r\nThe patient presents as a tremulous white male.  Speech is coherent and\r\nnormal in tempo.  Affect is somewhat anxious but otherwise unremarkable.\r\nHe has a history of intermittent derogatory auditory hallucinations but\r\nnone recently.  He was admitted to \"wanting to die\" but has not had\r\nspecific suicidal plans.  He says that if he were discharged he would \"be\r\nskating on thin ice\".  Cognitive functions were not formally tested at\r\nthis time.  When tested on 6A he did serial 7s poorly and could not\r\nremember any of the three items after the serial 7s task.  He was able to\r\nrecount recent news events.  \r\n \r\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\r\nThe patient was admitted to the medical unit where he received IV therapy\r\nfor his dehydration and was seen on psychiatric consults.  He was\r\ntransferred to the Psychiatry Service where he has remained for several\r\ndays during which time he has participated in group therapy sessions.  He\r\nhas shown no evidence of suicidality although he at times attempts to use\r\nthat as a threat but shows no evidence of depression.  He is homeless and\r\nhas requested referral to the homeless program and as it is felt he is\r\nstable at this time his request was honored.  He has been accepted to the\r\nhomeless program and is being transferred to the same.  \r\n \r\nPLAN:\r\nMr. Striplin is to be discharged to the homeless program.  He is currently\r\non medications that include:  Hydroxyzine 75 mg qhs, multi-vitamins one\r\ntablet daily, thiamine 100 mg daily, fluoxetine 20 mg daily, Risperidone 2\r\nmg bid.  He is on a regular diet.  His condition is considered stable and\r\nhe is considered competent.\r\n \r\nss d: 05/15/00; t: 05/15/00\r\n",

In the past, he\r\nhas called the Mental Hygiene Clinic in an intoxicated state, threatening\r\nto shoot himself.  He was lost hospitalized on 6A in July 1998.  At that\r\ntime, he was suicidal because he was facing a prison sentence.  Following\r\ndischarge from admission, he fled to Oklahoma, but the bounty hunters\r\nfound him and brought him back to West Virginia.  He then served six\r\nmonths in the Regional Jail for driving on a suspended license.  His\r\nlicense has been suspended because of DWI offenses.  After he got out of\r\nprison, he went to Key West where he essentially lived a life of an\r\nalcohol vagabound.  He ended up sleeping on the streets.  He was robbed\r\nseveral times.  He had severals admissions to a Psychiatric facility down\r\nthere for reasons which are unclear.  He said that he had trouble\r\ncontrolling his temper and was frequently angry, fighting and suicidal as\r\nwell as drinking.

He stated that he had put\r\na gun to his head this morning, but he could not pull the trigger so he\r\nthought he would come in here.  Last year on the 20th of 1998 at that time\r\nhe was on psychiatry.  Apparently, he has not been to any AAs since he\r\nleft.\r\n \r\nOBJECTIVE:  There are no significant changes in the objective findings on\r\nhim. An EKG revealed a sinus tach with some mild left ventricular\r\nhypertrophy.  There was some early repolarization.  There is no evidence\r\nof ischemia presently.  Blood gases revealed a pH of 7.64, PC02 18, P02\r\n112 and an 02 saturation of 99.  His urine for drugs revealed a\r\ncannabinoid level of 72.6 nanograms per dl.  SMA-6 and 12 revealed a GGT\r\nof 1344 and an AST of 90 with a total bilirubin of 1.7, a nonfasting\r\nglucose of 158.
