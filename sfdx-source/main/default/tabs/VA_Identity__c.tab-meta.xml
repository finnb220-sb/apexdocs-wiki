    >Goal is to create a Salesforce VA SOR Identity object (separate from Account/Contact) deployed in multiple Salesforce Orgs Allows middleware to work with a consistent
        pattern of objects/fields across all Orgs Not required by DIP, but would simplify configuration and reduce complexity In the future, this core VA SOR Identify Object could
        be part of a Salesforce common package, distributable and available for dependency management orchestration</description>
